Butter
Butter adds flavor, keeps the flour from clumping, and prevents the layers from sticking together. (200 g)

Salt
Just a pinch of salt brings out the delicate flavors in the choux pastry. (pinch)

Flour
All-purpose flour adds structure to the choux pastry and works with the water to create the perfect airy texture. (500 g)
