Cream Puff Ingredients
Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated cream puff recipe:

Instant Pudding Mix
This convenient cream puff recipe has an easy filling made with instant vanilla pudding mix.

Cream and Milk
You don't have to whip the heavy cream and milk â€” just mix them with the pudding mix and refrigerate to set.

Butter
Butter adds flavor, keeps the flour from clumping, and prevents the layers from sticking together.

Water
Choux pastry relies on steam for its texture, so this cream puff recipe calls for an entire cup of water.

Salt
Just a pinch of salt brings out the delicate flavors in the choux pastry.

Flour
All-purpose flour adds structure to the choux pastry and works with the water to create the perfect airy texture.

Eggs
Whole eggs support the structure, lend rich flavor and color, and add moisture to the choux pastry.
